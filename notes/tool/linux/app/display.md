ImageMagick's image viewer / editor.

## Usage

Left click to open the Commands menu.

Middle click to get coordinates and color information.
Use the arrow keys to move (optionally with `Alt` to move faster).
Be careful that if you scroll or change the zoom,
it affects the coordinates system.

As an image viewer it does not seem to work decently,
but here are some keyboard shortcuts that may be used.

| Shortcut | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `space` | Next image. |
| `backspace` | Next image. |
| `-` | Reset zoom. |
| `>` | Zoom in. |
| `<` | Zoom out. |
