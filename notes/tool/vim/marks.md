## Usage

Each mark is associated to a letter.
First press `m`.
Then:

- Use `a-z` for local (current file) mark;
- Use `A-Z` for global mark.

To jump to a mark,
press `'` (jump to line) or
`` ` `` (jump to position)
followed by the letter.

For example, for a mark with the letter `a`:

1. Use `ma` to mark.
2. Use `'a` or `` `a`` to jump to it.

Run `:marks` to get a list of marks.
